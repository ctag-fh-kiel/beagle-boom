# Beagle-Boom
Beagle Boom is a Eurorack Sampler based on the Beaglebone single-board computer.
It was build as part of a project for the Creative Technologies AG (CTAG) in behalf of the University of Applied Sciences Kiel.
The project's aim is to provide an easy to use sampler which has access to the freesound.org sound database. The key features are:

- Search, download, save and play any freesound sample
- Use MIDI and CV / gate keyboards
- Multiscreen System: In addition to the build in LCD display, any browser can be used as a second screen and keyboard input.
- Modular architecture: every component communicates over a message queue and can be replaced if wished.
- Browser based UI: The interface is browser based and can be styled by your liking.
